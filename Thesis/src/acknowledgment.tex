\section*{Acknowledgment}
  I would like to thank Franziska Horn and Dr. Nils Backhaus for their extraordinary support, patience and expert advice throughout the project. I would like to thank the team of the Chair of Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics of the Technische Universität Berlin for their steady willingness to discuss and advise me with any question I ever had. This project would have been impossible without the brilliant support of Hannes Korte, Dr. André Bergholz and Dr. Andreas Schäfer of the Implisense GmbH.
