\section{Results}
	\label{sec:results}
	We are going to describe the results of our study in detail. We obtained significant results for all our hypotheses testing the assistance with 50\% or 90\% correct pre-annotations. The tests of the assistance with only 10\% correct pre-annotations were not significant (Section~\ref{sec:resultsHypAC}). Neither are the comparisons of different assistance levels (Section~\ref{sec:resultsHypDF}).
